# Testing Requirement Code

# T1 

Produce a written report which outlines the plan and designs for tests of your application. The report must be based on an **analysis** and **review** of the code requirements, features and requirements in the design specification, and your own code. 

## T1.1
**Outline** the **context** of testing: why are you testing the application?

Since the application consists of ingesting logs which is crucial to security, developer operations and the system administration it is important to test the application because to meet the requirements of the client there should not be any fault in the final output. 

Testing the application ensures that the final application is reliable and the application has been met to a satisfactory standard. Testing the application also ensures that the right facilities are provided to the client, in terms of the delivery of the application which may need lower maintenance costs which will result in accurate, consistent and reliable outcomes. 

It is also important to test the application because in terms of the severity levels,there should not be any issues as to how the logs are being labelled. If a report is labelled as severe but in reality it is actually a low finding then it can create confusion for the client because it will consume their time to invest in the problem that is actually misleading and it will cost them money. 

The application should also be tested to prove that it performs effectively and to ensure that it does not result in failures as it can be costly in the future stages of the development. 

## T1.2
**Outline** the scope of testing:
- **what** have you identified to test?
- **how** much of the application are you testing?
